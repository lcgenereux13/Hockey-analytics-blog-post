Determining fair NHL player salaries and assessing General Manager effectiveness through novel player evaluation framework

_Louis-Charles Généreux and Allen Xu_


# Problem definition

As avid sports fans, we have always been intrigued by the opaque world of player evaluation. In sports like ice-hockey, where teams' salary spending is capped, signing the right players, at the right price is essential to attaining team success. With most National Hockey League (NHL) teams spending close to all the money available under the salary cap, a team's competitive edge comes partly from its ability to identify "under-priced" players. General Managers' (GMs) responsibility is to build rosters of high-performing, fairly-paid players to maximize their team's chances of success. 

GMs are often retired players, who rely more on subjective reports from a vast network of scouts than on data to make contractual decisions, creating biased decisions. Acknowledging that GMs have biases that lead them to paying salary premiums to players who might not be the highest performers on their teams, we wondered: are these premiums worth it? To answer this question we set out on a mission to determine each NHL players' __fair salary, or what each player should be paid based on his contribution to his team's success.__ In doing so, we:

* Built a tool to evaluate each player's performance based on team contribution metrics
* Clustered players based on said metrics and calculated in-cluster average salaries for comparable players
* Developed a framework to assess General Managers' effectiveness based on tendencies to over/under pay players relative to their contribution
